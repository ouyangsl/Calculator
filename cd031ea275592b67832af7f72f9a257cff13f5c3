      "message": "The change only makes sense if there\u0027s no other way to generate +/- Infinity from the calculator.  Infinity as a result isn\u0027t an error; the problem is accepting it as the result for divide-by-zero.\n\nAt the very least this needs a comment explaining why we\u0027re treating infinity as error.  Maybe one of the other reviewers has a different solution?",
